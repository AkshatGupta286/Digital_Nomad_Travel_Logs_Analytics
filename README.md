# Digital Nomad Travel Logs Analytics

## Overview
Pieter Levels, the founder of "nomadlist.com" released a dataset of the travel logs of 9,821 Digital Nomads associated with nomadlist.com. The travel logs are from 2014-2021 for the top 50 cities per continent.  
I am using that dataset to analyse the travel trends among digital nomads.  
The dataset can be downloaded from https://nomadlist.com/graph
